        <h1>Hello! I'm Emmalyn.</h1>

        <p> My name is Emmalyn Campau and I am a senior at The University of Michigan, where I am currently pursuing a Data Science major and Biology minor through
            the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. I am also starting the Accelerated Master Degree Program thrugh the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics this upcoming fall semester.
            I will graduate with my undergraduate degree in Winter 2024 and with my graduate degree in Winter 2025.
            I am very passionate about exploring the application of data analytics to the sciences, particularly biology and healthcare. 
            <br><br>
            In addition to my studies, I have a large interest in education, and design. This summer, I am working at Girls Who Code as a Lead Teaching Assistant for the Summer Immersion Program, where I will be teaching groups of high school girls and non-binary students about game design in p5.js.
            I will also be working on lesson planning and scheduling for my second year as a volunteer instructor for an introductory programming course for middle school students.
            I have experience learning, using, and teaching a wide variety of programming languages, such as C++, Python, R, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            <br><br>
            In my free time you'll often find me listening to music, watching sports, or spending
            time outdoors.
